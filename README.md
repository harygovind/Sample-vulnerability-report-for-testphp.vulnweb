This file documents the results of a Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT) conducted on the testphp.vulnweb project. The VAPT focused on identifying potential security weaknesses within the application.
It's important to note that a relatively small number of vulnerabilities were discovered as this is my first VAPT on a web application.

**Disclaimer**

This VAPT report is a point-in-time assessment and new vulnerabilities may emerge over time.

**NOTE**
*Sort the Vulnerabilities based on their severity*
